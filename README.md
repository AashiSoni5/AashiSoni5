Animal Classifier for Wildlife Enthusiasts made by Aashi Soni

I gathered images from Google, which provided a wide range of species, ensuring diversity in the dataset. By including images of reptiles, mammals, insects, birds, and marine animals, you created distinct categories for training.
accessed the Teachable Machine platform through its website, which offers a user-friendly interface for building models. No prior programming skills were required, making it an excellent tool for experimenting with machine learning
eachable Machine offers various project types, including image, sound, and pose recognition. For wildlife detection model, I selected the Image Project created several classes in the project, with each class representing a different category of animals (e.g., reptiles, mammals, insects, birds, and marine animals). For each class,I uploaded the images you had previously collected and organized from Google. Teachable Machine allows us to drag and drop images directly into the interface or upload them
Automated Species Identification: The model can be deployed in conservation areas to automatically identify different species captured by camera traps or drones
