Animal Classifier for Wildlife Enthusiasts

Overview

This project is an AI-based wildlife detection model created using Google Teachable Machine. The model is trained to recognize different species of animals such as reptiles, mammals, insects, birds, and marine animals by using images collected from Google. The goal is to automate the process of identifying animals from images.
Dataset
Images were collected from Google and sorted into folders based on the species of animals. The dataset was then uploaded to Google Teachable Machine for training, where each folder was assigned a class corresponding to the species group (reptiles, mammals, insects, birds, marine animals)
How It Works
Collect and sort images into folders based on species categories (reptiles, mammals, etc.).
Upload the folders to Google Teachable Machine and train the model by labeling each folder as a class.
Export the trained model and integrate it into a system where it can accept new images for classification.
When a new image is uploaded, the model predicts the category of the animal based on its training.
